2008-03-06	v.0.4.7

	internationalization. Use the common gettext ./configure options to
	change the I18n build options.
	--with-included-gettext uses the included GNU libintl. Not necessary unless 
	your distro lacks GNU gettext.
	--disable-nls disables I18n support for btnx-config

	* Improved GUI layout. Better structure for button options, removed
	"Clear" and "Save" buttons (redundant).
	* New type of event: configuration switch. Allows switching to previous,
	next, or a specific configuration in btnx "on the fly".

	button bug.
